# Ruby bindings to the Csound API

I wish somebody else had done it, so that I did not have to do it. However, so
far nobody has undertaken this task, so I'll give it a try.

## Status

Just started, so don't expect anything wonderful any time soon.

## Help Wanted

**HELP WANTED** and most welcome.
